# Bits of Rust
This is a repository of small Rust programs I write as I teach myself the language.

I love doing larger projects to sharpen my skills, but sometimes one needs to concentrate on
the fundamentals in smaller, quicker steps.

# List of Programs

| Name | Main Features | Description |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| cli_args | Command line argument parsing | Parses and prints different things depending on the arguments given on the command line |

# Future Work
Here are some Bits of Rust I want to write in the future:
- Something with traits. Students and people or something actually intersting if I can think of it.
- Closures and callbacks
- Async IO
- gRPC and/or protobufs
- Reading JSON from a TCP socket
- Writing JSON to a TCP socket/UDP.
